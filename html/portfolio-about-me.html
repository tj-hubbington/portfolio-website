                <h5>My Journey</h5>
                <p>Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m TJ, and I’ve spent the past decade immersed in the world of personal training, helping individuals transform their bodies and lives. From weight loss journeys to strength gains, I’ve been privileged to witness remarkable transformations and play a role in empowering others to achieve their fitness goals.</p>
                <p>However, life is a journey of evolution, and my path has led me to embrace a new challenge: software engineering. While personal training has been incredibly fulfilling, I've found myself increasingly drawn to the world of coding and technology. This transition represents not just a career shift, but a convergence of my passions for problem-solving, creativity, and continual learning.</p>
                <p>My journey in personal training began a decade ago, sparked by a deep-seated passion to improve my own athleticism. Armed with my level 3 certification and a relentless drive to make a difference, I dove headfirst into the world of fitness. Whether it was crafting custom training programs, providing nutritional guidance, or offering unwavering support, my mission was clear: to empower others to unlock their full potential and lead healthier, happier lives.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working with clients from all walks of life, each with their own unique goals and challenges. From busy professionals juggling demanding schedules to individuals overcoming health obstacles, I’ve witnessed firsthand the transformative power of dedication and perseverance. Every success story reaffirmed my belief in the profound impact of personalized support and tailored strategies.</p>

                <h5>Software Engineering</h5>
                <p>As fulfilling as my journey in personal training has been, I've always been drawn to the intersection of technology and human experience. The world of software engineering offers limitless opportunities to innovate, create, and solve complex problems—a challenge I couldn’t resist.</p>
                <p>My decision to transition into software engineering was not made lightly. It represents a culmination of years of self-discovery, fueled by a thirst for new knowledge and a desire to make a broader impact. Through intensive study, hands-on projects, and immersion in the tech community, I’m actively honing my skills and embracing the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
                <p>At its core, software engineering is about crafting solutions to real-world problems, a principle that resonates deeply with me. Whether it’s developing user-friendly applications, optimizing algorithms, or building scalable systems, I’m energized by the prospect of leveraging technology to enhance lives and drive positive change.</p>
                <p>Moreover, software engineering offers a dynamic and collaborative environment—a perfect fit for someone who thrives on challenge and continuous growth. The opportunity to work alongside talented individuals, tackle complex challenges, and contribute to innovative projects excites me beyond measure.</p>

While the road may be fraught with challenges, I approach it with a sense of determination and optimism, fueled by the knowledge that every obstacle is an opportunity for growth.</p>
                <p>In April 2024, I am set to complete an intensive frontend web development course, where I immersed myself in the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git programming languages. Through hands-on projects and guided instruction, I honed my skills in crafting responsive and visually appealing web interfaces, mastering the art of frontend development from conception to deployment.</p>
                <p>Armed with this newfound knowledge and practical experience, I’m eager to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, leveraging technology to create seamless user experiences and bring innovative ideas to life.</p>
                <p>Whether you’re here for fitness advice, tech insights, or simply to share in the journey, I invite you to join me as I navigate this exciting new terrain. Together, let’s embrace the possibilities, defy expectations, and make a lasting impact on the world around us.</p>
                <p>Thank you for being a part of this adventure!</p>
